# **Week 1 Lab Report**
## **Remote Access**
Hi! Today I am going to give you a tutorial on how how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.

There are 3 steps invloved:

**-Installing VScode**

**-Remotely Connecting**

**-Trying Some Commands**


>1. Installing VScode

 Go to Visual Studio Code website and follow the instructions given to download it on your computer: [using this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ,depending on your operating system.
 
 Once installed, a window like this should appear (may vary according to system and settings):

>2. Remotely Connecting

If you are on Windows, you need to install **git bash** in Visual Studio Code.

You can find your account specific username [here!](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

Next, open a terminal in VScode to ssh and enter the **ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6@ucsd.edu** . Replace the zz with your account username. The message will look a something like this:

Enter "yes."

Then it will prompt you to enter your password. On doing so, you will have successfully established remote connection.

>3. Trying some commands

Now, try to run some commands such as ** cd, pwd, ls -a.**

Here is an example of what the cd and pwd commands did on my computer:
