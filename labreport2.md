## Part 1

Here is my code for *StringServer*. It keeps track of a single string that gets added tp by incoming requests:


Example, using **/add-message** :

**Which methods in your code are called?**

The methods *StringServer* and then *handleRequest* are being called.

**What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?**

**Server.start(port, new Handler());** is a relevant argument.


How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.
