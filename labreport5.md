# Lab Report 5

For Lab report 3, I chose `find` command to research on and find alternates for. This time I choose `grep`.

Normally, `grep` command is cumbersome to use and not refined.


## Command 1 : `-r`

This will search for the string "search_string" in all files in the directory /path/to/directory and its subdirectories.

> Examples:

```
$  grep -r "Bahamas"

*the output was too long**

```

```
$  grep -r riajuneja


```

## Command 2 : `-i`

> What it does and  Why it is useful

This will search for the string "search_string" in the file file.txt, ignoring case.

> Examples:

```
$ grep -i "lAbradOr"

*displays all instances of labrador*

```

```
$  find grep -i "MAINLANDER"

*This displays all files of directory type*

```

The output was too long.

## Command 3 : `-o`

> What it does and Why it is useful

This will show only the part of each line in file.txt that matches the string "search_string".

> Examples:

```
$ grep -o "Canada"
```

```
$ grep -o "Labradpr"

```

## Command 4 : `-n`

> Source:

> What it does and Why it is useful

This shows line number of every instance of string.

> Examples:

```
$ grep -n "Labrador"
```


```
$ grep -n "this"
```
